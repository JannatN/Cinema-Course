					<h2>Cinema in Egypt</h2>

					<p><b>The Golden Age</b></p>

					<p>The 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s are generally considered the golden age of Egyptian cinema. In the
						1950s, Egypt's cinema industry was the world's third largest.[7] As in the West, films responded
						to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable genres (happy endings being the
						norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one
						critic, "If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites,
						it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which
						would manifest themselves in the box office."[8]

					</p>

					<p> In 1940,[9] the entrepreneur and translator Anis Ebeid established "Anis Ebeid Films", as the
						first subtitling company in Egypt and the Middle East, bringing hundreds of American and World
						movies to Egypt. Later he entered the movie distribution business too.[10]

						Political changes in Egypt after the overthrow of King Farouk in 1952 initially had little
						effect on Egyptian film. The Nasser regime sought control over the industry only after turning
						to socialism in 1961.[11] By 1966, the Egyptian film industry had been nationalized. As with all
						matters in that period, diametrical opinions can be found about the cinema industry then. In the
						words of Ahmed Ramzi, a leading man of the era, "it went to the dogs".[12] The "heavy government
						hand" that accompanied nationalization of Egyptian film "stifled innovative trends and sapped
						its dynamism".[11] However, considering a rather modern moderate review like that given by Dubai
						International Film Festival,[13] Most of the 44 Egyptian films featuring in the best 100 Arab
						films of all time were produced during that period. Notable titles included The Night of
						Counting The Years, Cairo Station and The Postman.</p>
